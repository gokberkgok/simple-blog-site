Our traffic fluctuates heavily every day, and our cloud footprint should scale dynamically to support this.</p><p>To support this scaling, Airbnb utilizes Kubernetes, an open source container orchestration system. We also utilize OneTouch, a service configuration interface built on top of Kubernetes, and is described in more detail in a previous <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/a-krispr-approach-to-kubernetes-infrastructure-a0741cff4e0c">post</a>.</p><p>In this post, we’ll talk about how we dynamically size our clusters using the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler, and highlight functionality we’ve contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling">sig-autoscaling community</a>. These improvements add customizability and flexibility to meet Airbnb’s unique business requirements.</p><h2><strong>Kubernetes Clusters at Airbnb</strong></h2><p>Over the past few years, Airbnb has shifted almost all online services from manually orchestrated EC2 instances to Kubernetes. Today, we run thousands of nodes across nearly a hundred clusters to accommodate these workloads. However, this change didn’t happen overnight. During this migration, our underlying Kubernetes cluster setup evolved and became more sophisticated as more workloads and traffic shifted to our new technology stack. This evolution can be split into three stages.</p><p>Stage 1: Homogenous Clusters, Manual Scaling</p><p>Stage 2: Multiple Cluster Types, Independently Autoscaled</p><p>Stage 3: Heterogeneous Clusters, Autoscaled</p><h2><strong>Stage 1: Homogenous Clusters, Manual Scaling</strong></h2><p>Before using Kubernetes, each instance of a service was run on its own machine, and manually scaled to have the proper capacity to handle traffic increases. Capacity management varied per team and capacity would rarely be un-provisioned once load dropped.</p><p>Our initial Kubernetes cluster setup was relatively basic. We had a handful of clusters, each with a single underlying node type and configuration, which ran only stateless online services. As some of these services began shifting to Kubernetes, we started running containerized services in a multi-tenant environment (many pods on a node). This aggregation led to fewer wasted resources, and consolidated capacity management for these services to a single control point at the Kuberentes control plane. At this stage, we scaled our clusters manually, but this was still a marked improvement over the previous situation.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 1400w" type="image/webp" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><source srcset="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1 1400w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*xgJUXKfck5DuQOg1" alt="An EC2 node running a single application vs. a Kubernetes node running 3 applications."></picture></p><p>Figure 1: EC2 Nodes vs Kubernetes Nodes</p><h2><strong>Stage 2: Multiple Cluster Types, Independently Autoscaled</strong></h2><p>The second stage of our cluster configuration began when more diverse workload types, each with different requirements, sought to run on Kubernetes. To accommodate their needs, we created a cluster type abstraction. A “cluster type” defines the underlying configuration for a cluster, meaning that all clusters of a cluster type are identical, from node type to different cluster component settings.</p><p>More cluster types led to more clusters, and our initial strategy of manually managing capacity of each cluster quickly fell apart. To remedy this, we added the Kubernetes <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler">Cluster Autoscaler</a> to each of our clusters. This component automatically adjusts cluster size based on pod requests — if a cluster’s capacity is exhausted, and a pending pod’s request could be filled by adding a new node, Cluster Autoscaler launches one. Similarly, if there are nodes in a cluster that have been underutilized for an extended period of time, Cluster Autoscaler will remove these from the cluster. Adding this component worked beautifully for our setup, saved us roughly 5% of our total cloud spend, and the operational overhead of manually scaling clusters.</p>', 'tech', 'Gokberk', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/0*CedYKpSYMIGEiX7m', '2024-09-06 23:06:28'),

These are the top attractions in Saint John and the best day trips from the city.</p><p>While the rugged coast of New Brunswick is a major draw road tripper, there are plenty of things to do in Saint John located in the heart of the city. We suggest spending at least two nights to take in the energy of the town and to explore the nightlife.<br><br><strong>1. Reversing Falls</strong><br>As one local said to us, “The Reversing Falls of Saint John is probably the most overrated attraction in the city, but the science behind it is interesting.” And once you understand that the Bay of Fundy is so powerful that it reverses the flow of the Saint John River twice a day, it’s pretty cool.</p><p>We checked it out from two different viewpoints. I highly recommend going to the Reversing Falls Skywalk and Bridge to see it from above.</p><p>Saint John itself s located on the Bay of Fundy creating a unique phenomenon as the&nbsp;Bay of Fundy’s high tide collides with the Saint John River. As the tides rise, it overpowers the river reversing the flow. It’s a cool thing to see the river flowing one way and then smashing against the tide creating rapids and whirlpools.<br><br>…</p>', 'travel', 'Gokberk', 'https://theplanetd.com/images/Saint-John-New-Brunswick-Park-941x627.jpg', '2024-09-06 19:41:25'),

	(223232, 'Air Fryer Dry Ribs', '<p><strong>If you’ve had dry ribs at the pub and want to make them at home, these ribs are for you.</strong></p><p>If you’re a pub-lover just for the pub food, you’re my kind of person. I always, always happily agree to go to the bar or the pub because bar food! Bite-sized, usually deep-fried, and always delicious – I’m down.</p><h2>What are dry ribs?</h2><p>Dry ribs are deep-fried, seasoned pork riblets. They’re crispy, juicy, and completely addictive. I’m pretty sure dry ribs aren’t a popular menu item, but whenever I see them I’m excited because they’re so good. Usually, I see riblets served as saucy ribs but trust me when I say, dry riblets are superior. First off, they’re faster and easier to make and second, they aren’t super sticky and saucy which makes them a better finger food.</p><p>These ribs are perfect for game day, a snacky-snack, or even a meal if you make a vegetable side dish and some rice. I love them because they’re pretty hands off thanks to the air fryer. Traditionally dry ribs are deep-fried but I’m on the <a href="https://iamafoodblog.com/category/recipes/gadgets/air-fryer-recipes/">air fryer train</a> and I’m not getting off anytime soon.</p>', 'food', 'Gokberk', 'https://iamafoodblog.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/air-fryer-dry-ribs-9580w-2048x1366.webp', '2024-09-08 19:50:54');
